1. Monetization (Stripe / Billing) 💳
Right now, the app is entirely free. You need a monetization engine.

Pointer: Integrate Stripe. Create a free tier (e.g., 3 documents/month) and a "Pro" plan for unlimited documents, custom branding, and larger file sizes.
2. Automated Reminders (Cron Jobs) ⏰
You currently have a manual "Remind Signers" button, which is great! But users forget to log in and click it.

Pointer: Set up a daily cron job (using Vercel Cron or Supabase Edge Functions). Have the system automatically detect documents expiring in 48 hours and automatically fire a Resend email nudging the pending signers.
3. Team Workspaces (B2B Growth) 🏢
Currently, documents and templates are tied directly to an initiator_email. If a company signs up, they will want their HR and Sales teams to share the same templates.

Pointer: Add a workspaces or teams table to Supabase. Allow users to invite colleagues to their workspace so they can collaborate on templates and view their team's centralized audit log.
4. Advanced Security (Signer 2FA) 🔐
While signature links sent via email are standard, higher-end legal agreements require stricter identity verification.

Pointer: When a user creates a document, give them an option to require "Signer 2FA". When the signer clicks the link, prompt them to enter a password (set by the sender) or an SMS code before the PDF is decrypted and shown.
5. Advanced PDF Fields & Attachments 📎
You have the core fields (Signature, Date, Text, Checkbox) working well with pdf-lib.

Pointer: Add "Dropdowns" and "Radio Buttons." More importantly, add an "Attachment Request" field. Often, signers need to append a picture of their Driver's License/ID or a voided check before the signature is considered complete.
6. Public Webhooks & API (Enterprise Tier) 🚀
Businesses love to automate document generation (e.g., automatically sending an NDA when someone fills out a form on their website).

Pointer: Add a "Developer Settings" tab where users can generate a GetSign API key and configure webhook URLs to receive automatic POST requests the second a document becomes "Completed."
7. Bulk Sending (Growth Hack) 📨
Pointer: Allow users to upload a .csv of 100 names and emails, select a Template, and instantly fire off 100 uniquely tracked signature requests at once.
